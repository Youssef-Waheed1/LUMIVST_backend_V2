      "value": "Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group’s to cease to continue as a going concern.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, with relevant safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.Consolidated statement of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Group. Total comprehensive income of subsidiary is attributed to the shareholders of the Company.When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring its accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, when applicable, to be the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue once they are earned."

The contract assets relates to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the accounts receivables for the same type of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for accounts receivable are reasonable approximation of loss rates for contract assetsThe Group measures the loss allowance for accounts receivable by setting credit limits for individual customers and by monitoring outstanding balances on an ongoing basis. Customers that are graded as \"high risk\" are placed on a separate list, and future credit sales are made only with approval of key directors. The group assess the recoverable amount of its receivables to ensure adequate allowance for impairment is made by applying simplified approach to measure expected credit loss. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified GDP and inflation rate to be the most relevant factors and accordingly adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. For ageing of receivables refer note 13.Cash on hand and at banksCredit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy.

Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.The consolidated statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after zakat in the subsidiaries and associates.The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.After the application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate in the statement of profit or loss.Upon loss of significant influence, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the investment upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in profit or loss."

If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

      "value": "The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the asset given or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed of operation and the portion of the CGU retained."

      "value": "The Group measures financial instruments, such as financial derivatives, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability; orIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liabilityThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset’s highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observableLevel 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservableFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period."

The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

Revision to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities affected in the future periods. As the situation is rapidly evolving with future uncertainties, management will continue to assess the impact based on prospective developments."

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.In respect of contracts with customers for sale of property, in addition to the five-step model, the Company satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs; or The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised goods or services, it creates a contract asset based on the amount of consideration earned by the performance. Where the amount billed to the customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, this gives rise to a contract liability.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. The Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development.The sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at the point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.The sale of property under development are recognized over time. In order to determine the appropriate method of recognizing revenue, the Group assesses its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Group has assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use to and It has considered the factors that indicate that it is restricted (contractually or practically) from readily directing the property under development for another use during its development based on the sale agreements entered with customers.Also, the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination. The matter decided by management as per applicable relevant laws and regulations and therefore management's judgement is based on their interpretation of law (as per legal advice obtained by management), that they would be compensated for the payments due from the customer.The Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of income due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Revenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered."

Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.

      "value": "The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the asset given or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed of operation and the portion of the CGU retained."

This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observableLevel 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservableFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period."

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.In respect of contracts with customers for sale of property, in addition to the five-step model, the Company satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs; or The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised goods or services, it creates a contract asset based on the amount of consideration earned by the performance. Where the amount billed to the customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, this gives rise to a contract liability.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. The Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development.The sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at the point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.The sale of property under development are recognized over time. In order to determine the appropriate method of recognizing revenue, the Group assesses its contracts with customers to determine whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. The Group has assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use to and It has considered the factors that indicate that it is restricted (contractually or practically) from readily directing the property under development for another use during its development based on the sale agreements entered with customers.Also, the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination. The matter decided by management as per applicable relevant laws and regulations and therefore management's judgement is based on their interpretation of law (as per legal advice obtained by management), that they would be compensated for the payments due from the customer.The Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of income due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Revenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered."

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed of operation and the portion of the CGU retained."

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability; orIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liabilityThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset’s highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observableLevel 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservableFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period."

Reviewed on sample basis, the contracts for the sale of properties and plots of land to identify the performance obligations of the Group under these contracts and assess whether these performance obligations are satisfied over a period of time or at point in time. Recalculated the revenue on sample basis, using the output method and compared it with the computation made by management. Performed a test of details of a sample of recorded revenue transactions and compared with supporting documents to verify the occurence and accuracy of recorded revenue. Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements."

Revenue recognition which includes mainly the sale of properties, including villas, apartments and plots of land involves significant inherent risk due to the judgement and estimation involved. Audit of judgements around the percentage of completion of projects, including the surveys of performance completed to date is an item which requires significant audit attention, in particular consideration of: The analysis of whether the contracts comprise one or more performance obligations; Determining whether the performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time; and Estimation of total costs required to meet performance obligations under the contracts with customers.Due to the inherent risks in the revenue recognition process and the significance of revenue value, revenue recognition was considered as a key audit matter.Refer to note 4.24 of the consolidated financial statements on the accounting policy for revenue recognition and the respective disclosure in note 22.We have performed the following procedures: Obtained an understanding of the process of key controls surrounding the revenue recognition process.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance, i.e. the Board of Directors, are responsible for overseeing the Group financial reporting process."

      "value": "Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, with relevant safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders,potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties,rights arising from other contractual arrangements, andany additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.Consolidated statement of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Group. Total comprehensive income of subsidiary is attributed to the shareholders of the Company.When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring its accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, when applicable, to be the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.

A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue once they are earned."

'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group’s to cease to continue as a going concern.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, with relevant safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.

In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.

This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue once they are earned."

The contract assets relates to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the accounts receivables for the same type of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for accounts receivable are reasonable approximation of loss rates for contract assetsThe Group measures the loss allowance for accounts receivable by setting credit limits for individual customers and by monitoring outstanding balances on an ongoing basis. Customers that are graded as \"high risk\" are placed on a separate list, and future credit sales are made only with approval of key directors. The group assess the recoverable amount of its receivables to ensure adequate allowance for impairment is made by applying simplified approach to measure expected credit loss. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified GDP and inflation rate to be the most relevant factors and accordingly adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group’s to cease to continue as a going concern.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, with relevant safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.

'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group’s to cease to continue as a going concern.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, with relevant safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due.

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.

Revenue recognition which includes mainly the sale of properties, including villas, apartments and plots of land involves significant inherent risk due to the judgement and estimation involved. Audit of judgements around the percentage of completion of projects, including the surveys of performance completed to date is an item which requires significant audit attention, in particular consideration of: The analysis of whether the contracts comprise one or more performance obligations; Determining whether the performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time; and Estimation of total costs required to meet performance obligations under the contracts with customers.Due to the inherent risks in the revenue recognition process and the significance of revenue value, revenue recognition was considered as a key audit matter.Refer to note 4.27 of the consolidated financial statements on the accounting policy for revenue recognition and the respective disclosure in note 22.We have performed the following procedures: Obtained an understanding of the process of key controls surrounding the revenue recognition process. Performed walkthroughs of relevant key controls to determine whether they are designed, implemented and operating effectively. Reviewed on sample basis, the contracts for the sale of properties and plots of land to identify the performance obligations of the Group under these contracts and assess whether these performance obligations are satisfied over a period of time or at point in time. Recalculated the revenue on sample basis, using the output method and input method, whichever is applicable, and compared it with the computation made by management. Performed a test of details of a sample of recorded revenue transactions and compared with supporting documents to verify the occurrence and accuracy of recorded revenue.

'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, , actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use.

Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss.

It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.

To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.Borrowings are derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss as other income or finance charges.General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale, as appropriate. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.Other borrowing costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income."

The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders,potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties,rights arising from other contractual arrangements, andany additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.Consolidated statement of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Group.

All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, when applicable, to be the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture."

If any such indication exists and where the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount being the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.The cash generating unit (CGU) at which the impairment assessment and testing is performed, is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount."

      "value": "Impairment of financial assetsThe impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, contract assets and debt investments at FVOCI, but not to investments in equity instruments. The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated.

This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed of operation and the portion of the CGU retained."

      "value": "The Group measures financial instruments, such as financial derivatives, at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability; orIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liabilityThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits from the asset’s highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would utilize the asset in its highest and best use.The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy. This is described, as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observableLevel 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservableFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period."

The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders,potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties,rights arising from other contractual arrangements, andany additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.Consolidated statement of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Group. Total comprehensive income of subsidiary is attributed to the shareholders of the Company.When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring its accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9, when applicable, to be the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture."

The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders,potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties,rights arising from other contractual arrangements, andany additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.Consolidated statement of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Group. Total comprehensive income of subsidiary is attributed to the shareholders of the GroupCompany.When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring its accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation."

A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due.

This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date.

It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.

The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost, net of impairment losses, if any. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances, and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent consideration (except that which is classified as equity) is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue once they are earned."

A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due.

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.The group as a lessorLeases, where the Group does not Materially transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.

The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified, or impaired.The Group’s financial assets at amortized cost include contract assets and trade receivables.Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive incomeGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled into profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, and expenditure is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when it is incurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."

The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

      "value": "The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, and expenditure is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when it is incurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."

The impairment methodology is generally dependent on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach as required by IFRS 9.At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Impairment allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payment are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group."

Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.The Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15. This includes:a)Identification of a contract with a customer, i.e., agreements with the Group that creates enforceable rights and obligations.b)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract, i.e., promises in such contracts to transfer products or services.c)Determination of the transaction price which shall be the amount of consideration the Group will expect to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations (and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties).d)Allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone estimated selling price of the products or services provided to the customer.e)Recognition of revenue when/as a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the promised products or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control. This may be over time or at a point in time.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:a)The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; orb)The Group performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or c)The Group performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.For performance obligations, where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. (i)Revenue from contracts with customers for sale of propertiesThe Group enters into contracts with customers to sell property that are either completed or under development. The Group evaluates the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of properties based on analysis of the rights and obligations under the terms of each contract and legal advice from the Group’s legal counsel.Sale of completed unitsThe sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at a point in time when control transfers. For unconditional exchange of contracts, this generally occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. For conditional exchanges, this generally occurs when all significant conditions are satisfied.Sale of developing propertiesIn respect of contracts with customers for sale of developing property, the revenue is recognized over a period of time. Whereby, the Group assessed that the Group’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use. Also the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, and entitled to an amount that at least compensates it for performance completed to date (usually costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin) by having enforceable rights of being compensated for work completed to date in the event of any dispute and contract termination.In measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations, the Group uses output method, whereby the revenue recognition is based on the measurement of the value of work transferred / completed to date in comparison with the remaining goods or services to be provided under the contract. The value of work transferred / completed to date is based on consultant’s reports.(ii)Rental incomeThe Group is the lessor in operating leases. Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature, except for contingent rental income which is recognized when it arises. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognized as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.Tenant lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the management are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the right to receive them arises.(iii)Service revenueRevenue from rendering of services is recognized over a period of time when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. Where the outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered"

Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity investments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in equity instruments under this category.DerecognitionA financial asset is primarily derecognized when:The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, orThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained Materially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the assetWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained Materially all of the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.A provision for the expected credit loss should be recognized over the life of the financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial instrument increases Materially since the initial recognition and the expected credit loss is an expected weighted estimate of the present value of the credit loss. This value is measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Group under the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive arising from the expectation of several future economic scenarios, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment on an individual basis for each asset of individual value and collectively for other assets that are not individually significant.Provisions for loss of credit losses are presented as a reduction of the total carrying amount of financial assets at amortized cost."

If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value fewer costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the statement of profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in the statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (''CGU\") that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed of operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed of operation and the portion of the CGU retained."

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the number of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.B-Lease liabilitiesAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the number of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments, or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.C-Short-term leases and leases of low-value assetsShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are items that do not meet the Company’s capitalization threshold and are considered to be insignificant for the consolidated statement of financial position for the Group as a whole. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized, and expenditure is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when it is incurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized."
